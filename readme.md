## About Model Randomforest
This research paper focuses on the Random Forest classification algorithm for identifying faults in microgrids and offers an in-depth structure integrating data mining, data analysis, and machine learning. The Machine Learning model shows an impressive result to recognise and classify different kinds of faults with achieving accuracy rates higher than 96.83% and as high as 98.69% (Table 1). After comparing the Random Forest classifier with other machine learning classifiers we got the  result in terms of Accuracy is 98%(Table 2). This improves grid stability and reduces downtime. The methods that have been described offer a strong basis for additional study as the energy scenario changes. Integration of new technologies, adapting to different power system layouts, and actual deployment scenarios might be included in the research process. This research stimulates continuous innovation in fault detection, and performing additional power system operations that are more flexible, effective, and reliable.
